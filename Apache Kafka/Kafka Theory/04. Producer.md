# Producer

* Producer writes data to topics
* Producer select the broker automatically
* Producer automically recover if the broker is lost or damaged.

## Producer Acknowledgment of data writes
1. acks=1: Producer won't wait for acknowledgment(possible data loss)
2. acks=2: Producer will wait for leader acknowledgment(limited data loss)
3. acks=3: Leader + replicas acknowledgment(no data loss)


## Message Key
* Producer can choose to send a key with the message(string, number, etc..)
* If key=null data is sent round robin (broker 101 then 103 then 103 continues)
* If a key is sent then all message for that key will always go to same partition
* A key is basically sent if you need message ordering for a specific field

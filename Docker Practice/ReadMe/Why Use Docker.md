For Example :- We are using `Redis` in our project, so to setup redis we have to follow certain steps.

    wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-5.0.5.tar.gz

When we tried to install the redis we got some error we tried trobleshooting it and resolved, not to repeat this steps,
to reduce the work and to reduce the process of setuping up the project, we use **Docker**.

> **Docker** make it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setuo or dependencies.
